## About

![The Pineapple God: a pineapple with sunglasses.](assets/pineglasses.png "The Pineapple God: a pineapple with sunglasses.")

A Pineapple God has teleported you to a tropical archipelago, and demands that you surround it with followers!

1. Collect seeds around the archipelago
2. Use your peashooter to plant them on horizontal surfaces
3. Walk nearby grown pineapples to harvest them
4. Bring them to the Pineapple God until it is satisfied


## Controls

- <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> → Move

- <kbd>Mouse movement</kbd> → Look

- <kbd>Mouse primary click</kbd> → Shoot

- <kbd>Space</kbd> → Jump

- <kbd>Space</kbd> (held) → **Bunnyhop!**

- <kbd>Shift + R</kbd> → Respawn if stuck

## Leaderboards

The Pineapple god will keep track of the time it takes you to bring it 150 pineapples, and will compare it with that of his other servants. **Can you be the fastest?**

_The leaderboards are experimental, unmoderated, and have no anti-cheat. Please be nice!_


## How to go faster

Pineapple Surf is centered on the mechanic of bunnyhopping to move faster!

The mechanics are similar to those of [the first Half-Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WschEm9uYao): a simple way to start going faster is holding <kbd>Space</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd> while constantly turning right in a circle.
